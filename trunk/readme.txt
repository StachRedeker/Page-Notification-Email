Eliminate manual notifications. Page Notification Email lets editors send update emails from WordPress.

== Description ==
Page Notification Email puts and end to manually informing stakeholders when a page is changed. The plugin adds a meta box to the edit page that allows the editor to enter one or more email addresses. Press the button to send an email to the inputted email addresses directly from the WordPress back-end. The email text is set globally from a WordPress settings page.

== Installation ==
1. Upload and activate the plugin.
2. Go to the settings page to configure your email subject, HTML message, and to select which post types should display the Notification Email meta box.
3. Edit a post or page and locate the meta box in the editor to add email addresses and send notifications.

== Use Cases ==

   only Pages and Posts are enabled, but you can add other post types as needed.
